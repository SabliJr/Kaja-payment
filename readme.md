# 🚀 CrossChainPay

**CrossChainPay** is a next-generation payment gateway inspired by Stripe, but built for the Web3 ecosystem.  
It allows any developer or merchant to accept payments on the web in a seamless and programmable way —  
whether the customer pays in native crypto, fiat-backed tokens on XRPL, or even cross-chain assets like USDT on Ethereum.

## 🔥 Features

- 💸 Accept native XRPL payments (XRP, RLUSD)
- 🏦 Fiat-backed token payments (e.g., USD, EUR) via XRPL-issued stablecoins
- 🌉 Cross-chain payments (e.g., USDT on Ethereum → auto-swapped to XRP via Binance API)
- ⚡ Fast, programmable, and developer-friendly integration
- 🌍 Built with modern tech stack: React, Vite, AdonisJS, Tailwind

## 🧠 Why this project?

Crypto payments today are either too technical or too fragmented.  
We wanted to create a **Stripe-like developer experience** for crypto-native and fiat-token payments on XRPL,  
with **optional cross-chain settlement** — fully programmable, simple to integrate, and ready for the Web3 economy.
